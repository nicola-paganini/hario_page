<h1>üåü Inspiration for the Website</h1>
<p>
<strong>I wanted to build a website where beginners can find all the relavant information they need to pick their first filter coffee dripper.</strong>
When I had started getting into coffee, I realised how difficult it was to find an all-in-one website that summarises the differences between
the many drippers offered in the market.</p>

</p>


<p>
It was easy to feel overwhelmed with the options and overly specific reviews by coffee experts 
which only confused beginners and prevented them from getting started with experimenting with coffee. Additionally, it was difficult to source sellers
who sold official, authentic drippers in Malaysia as many counterfeit products were listed online, unbeknownst to new coffee hobbists.
</p>

<p>Thus, I had designed this website inspired by my own struggles in getting into coffee brewing.</p>
